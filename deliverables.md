- Answer these CodeLearn Rails Models exercise questions:
  - What model method allows you to make a new model instance and save it?<br>The '.create' model allows a developer to make a new model instance and save it all in one step; as opposed to using two separate models '.new' and '.save' separately.  Thus, if the intention is to save a newly made model instance, one is better off using '.create' to make and save it at the same time.<br>
  - If I wanted to find all `Bulldog`s with the `breed` of `'English'`, what line in Ruby would I execute?<br>We can search a database through a particular name to find a particular value using the following pseudocode: Database.find_by_field_name("field_value").  So if Bulldog is the database, breed is the field name, and English is the field value, we would execute the Ruby line 'Bulldog.find_by_breed("English")' to find all Bulldog's with the breed of English (the single quotation marks are to be omitted in the actual code of course).<br>
