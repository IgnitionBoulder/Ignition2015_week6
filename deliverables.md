- Answer these CodeLearn Rails Models exercise questions:
  - What model method allows you to make a new model instance and save it? If we keep the example that is in the next question: Bulldog.create(:breed => "English")
  - If I wanted to find all `Bulldog`s with the `breed` of `'English'`, what line in Ruby would I execute? Bulldog.find_by_breed("English")
  - How do you delete all instance of a certain model? Again, following the dog example: Bulldog.delete_all
